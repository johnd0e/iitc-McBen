ingress intel total conversion (IITC) - Experimental Fork
=========================================================

This is an experimental Fork!
Some part of the code are just Proof-Of-Concepts and may fail on everydays buisness.
Especially the mobile version won't run out-of-the-box. Because this is not in the scope of this fork.


I highly recommend use the official one:

### Quickstart

To build the browser scripts from source you will need Python (either a late version 2.x, or 3.0+). It should
build correctly on Linux and Windows (and, probably, Macs, FreeBSD, etc)

Run the `build.py local` script to build the code.

If all goes well, output of the build will end up in `build/local` subfolder.

You can create a custom build settings file, `localbuildsettings.py` - look in the supplied
`buildsettings.py` for details.
